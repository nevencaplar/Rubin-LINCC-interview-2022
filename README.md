## Contents of the repository:

Folder `Software_PFS_model_creation` contains a class that I developed to model the observed point spread function for Prime Focus Spectrograph. It allows the user to specify the details of the wavefront and the pupil's illumination to create a realistic psf model. Given the data, the algorithm can also move the created model to fit the data. The code is still in development, and we are implementing it in the data reduction pipeline for Prime Focus Spectrograph. Notebook `Zernike_Modelling_for_PFS_Example.ipynb` contained within shows the very most straightforward examples of the use of the code. 

The folder `Technical_work_Black_dots` contains the code and the notebook I hope to present. I would be happy to discuss the code contained in this folder as well.
